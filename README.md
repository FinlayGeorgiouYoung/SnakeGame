# SnakeGame
Recreated the retro game Snake using Java Swing. 

### How to Run
- Open the project up in an IDE.
- Run the class Main.
- A small window will pop up with the game, and will say where to click to start the game.
- Once you click start, use the arrow keys to direct the snake.

### How to play
- Move the snake with the arrow keys.
- Each time you collect a red apple, your score will increase, and the snake will increase in length.
- If you collect a white triangle, the speed of your snake will increase.
- If you collect a yellow pie shape, you will get extra score, with no snake length increase.
- You lose the game, by touching one part of the snake with another part of the snake.
- Your aim is to get as much score as possible.
